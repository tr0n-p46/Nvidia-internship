1. Initially I thought of writing Vec2D and extend Vec3D from it but I found it wasn't so useful to me so wrote Vec3D directly.
2. The entire Class declaration is given in the header file Vec3D.h and it's corresponding implementation in Vec3D.cpp
3. Constructors
	-> Overloaded constructors for initializing under several situations like using 2D point with this etc.
4. Getters and Setters
	-> Member variables x,y,z can only be accessed through getters and setters and if inherited in another class.
5. Operator Overloading
	->  Operators used with basic data types have been overloaded to be used with Vec3D type objects in a similar fashion.
6. Mathematical operations
	-> Normalize
	-> Magnitude
	-> Cross Product
	-> Dot product
	-> Distance

In Linux :
	Compiling : g++ 2.cpp Vec3D -o 2
